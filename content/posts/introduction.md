## Hello & Welcome to my blog! :v:

I intend to write here about my projects, my experimentations or any other subject related to computer science that interests me. Essentially speaking, this blog is a dev blog.

### What am I doing?

I'm currently working on a few personal projects, most of which are related to [Boring Man](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346120/Boring_Man__Online_Tactical_Stickman_Combat/):
- bm-rcon, *C# library for doing some RCON scripting*
- bm-mods, *Collection of mostly gamemodes using bm-rcon*
- Bmaptimizer, *Tool to optimize maps made using the map editor in-game*

Other than those projects, I'm working on this blog (*surprised?*) and on a web app to easily find the items on [itch.io](https://itch.io) that are 100% on-sale, making them free.

There are some projects I want to come back to and remake them using something other than pure JS.

Also, I'm doing my best in documenting and testing my programs because I hate when my future self comes back and, after trying to decipher, decides to scrap everything and redo it from scratch or to abandon whatever he wanted to do.  
Self-explanatory code is nice to have, but it doesn't happen that often.

I'm currently learning Golang and Elm because it sounds fun.

### All good things come to an end
Have a nice day or a nice night and feel free to check the rest of the blog! :smile:
