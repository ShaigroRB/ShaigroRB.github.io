**Hey there! :wave:**

I'm a French Software Developer. Shaigro is the main nickname I use, hence the name of the blog (*surprising, ain't it?*).

This blog has multiple purposes:
1. I'm not someone who is good at explaining stuff, even if it is something I made. I hope that writing about my projects and experimentations will help me to improve.
2. Blogs are one of the main source of learning and help I've come across. I got a lot from blogs and I want to give back to the community, even if it's only a small contribution.
3. Having a way to tell about what am I working on is the best way for me to keep on working on it.

Also, I have a list of projects & experimentations ideas that you can find [here](https://hackmd.io/@tYTq4U8GTF2YypVkdVWotA/prog-ideas). Feel free to use some of them for your own purposes.
